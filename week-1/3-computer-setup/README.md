# U1.W1: Computer Set-Up Instructions

Now that you know a bit about your command line, you can now get your computer set up for DBC!

Setting up your computer can be tricky, and there are specific technologies we will need you to have in Phases 0, 1, and 2. We've created instructions for installing each of these in Linux, Mac, and Windows.

If you have already set up your computer with a dev environment, please make sure you have each of the necessary technologies installed.

NOTE: These instructions assume you have a "clean" environment and don't have anything funky going on in your system. It should go smoothly if you start with a clean slate, but it may take significantly more time if you have set up a dev environment before. Also, some of the commands will change the way your terminal and sublime look, so be prepared for that. You can always change it back if you would prefer. If you install the dotfiles, it will change your path and overwrite any manual configurations you had.

If you run into installation problems, please join [office hours](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com/office_hours) to ask a guide or request a tutoring session (use the [tutoring request form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com)). Our guides are not experts at computer set up, that is a different skill, but they should help you at least google your way to a solution. Due to the many differences in environments, it's impossible to create perfect instructions for everyone.
