#U1.W3: Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment

## Learning Competencies
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers
- Compare integers and floats
- Identify and use strings
- Define local variables

## Summary
For the challenges in week 3 you will want to read specified chapters in Chris Pine's [*Learn to Program*](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/).

In this challenge you will go through basic mathematical operations.

## Releases

## Release 0: Read Ch. 2: Numbers
You may want to save everything in Sublime, or you can go in to your terminal and use the Ruby REPL. REPL stands for read-eval-print-loop. The Ruby REPL is called IRB (<b>I</b>nteractive <b>R</b>u<b>b</b>y. You can access irb by typing `irb` in the console (suprise!). You can use irb as a sandbox to test methods and run your code.

For example

```ruby
~ :> irb
irb(main):001:0> 1+2
=> 3
irb(main):002:0>
```

If you want to work in sublime, you can write your code in a file with the .rb extension and run it in the terminal using `ruby <filename>.rb`. Make sure that you are outputting something to the terminal when using the method. For outputting to the terminal you can use p puts and print. p will return the evaluated code AND print to the console. puts will return nil and print the output to the console. print will not add spaces to the end of the outputs.



## Release 1: Summarize
Go to the [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file associated with this challenge. Go to the numbers section and answer the questions in the "summary" section.

## Release 2: Try it!
In section 2.5, Pine provides two great mini-challenges. Create these two programs and paste your code into the Ruby section in your [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file.

**Mini-challenges**
Write a program that calculates and outputs the:
- Hours in a year
- Minutes in a decade

## Release 3: Read Ch.3 Letters

Pay close attention, but you won't need to do any exercises based on this chapter.

## Release 4: Read Ch. 4 Variables and Assignment
Again, follow along and take a few notes (if you're that type of person) on variable assignment.

## Release 5: Mini-challenges
Navigate to the following directories within this folder. Each has a README with instructions for how to do the challenge, a my_solution.rb file where you should put your work, and a spec file with tests to run.

- [Defining Variables #1](../exercises/1-defining-variables)
- [Simple String Methods](../exercises/2-simple-string-methods)
- [Local Variables and Basic Arithmetical Operations](../exercises/3-local-variables)


## Release 6: Reflect
Using the [Reflection Guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md), reflect on what you learned. Write your response in the "Reflection" section of your my_solution.md file.
