  <h2>Pairing Is Caring</h2>
  <h4>1/4/15</h4>

Pairing with others is a rewarding yet challenging experience.You are meeting someone new for the first time, immedietely have to let your guard down and try and understand this person and quickly approach a difficult problem together as seamlessly as possible. The more you do it the better you get at it but everytime you still have a feeling of anxiety and heightened awareness that you must strive to give a good impression and show your ability to code well. These two facets of pairing go hand in hand and if you can do both well you will have an amazing pairing session. If one of them falters than it will be a struggle but we are all here to get better.

When I was pairing I really feel like it's rewarding to connect with people that are undergoing the same process that you are and see what their perspective or take on different problems are. I really thought it was cool to see things that I hadn't thought of and to try and see where other people are coming from.What can be difficult and frustrating to me is if someone you are pairing with is just not opening up and having a bad day and not expressing this before hand; in the end we are just programming and it shouldn't be such a big deal.

When I read my feedback I'm a very sensitive person and critical of myself so it's really hard for me to hear people's perspective on our pairing session. In the end it's okay and I feel like I improve from hearing people's feedback. If it's positive feedback it's really great, and if it's negative feedback it's great but there's always a little jolt that you feel as though maybe you could have done something a little better in the session to have changed the person's mind. Any negative or should I say constructive criticism should be be used as a positive influence and I use it to drive me and motivate me to fill in the gaps if I need to learn something or need to improve any a certain direction.

The critical feedback that I have read and received since week-1 was that I need to improve in terms of knowing my git commands, that I need to be less impatient for instruction and need to stay calm and not continue switching back to the material to see what to do next.The other feedback is all mostly positive with little things hear and there about my actions during pairing like I could be more talkative in certain situations or could improve in an area technically like hashes and being more pro-active when it comes to refactoring code.
