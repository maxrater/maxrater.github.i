      As new technology's and innovations pour into existence we as a society are often lagging behind in terms of how to regulate, co-exist and understand how these changes will affect our future. This tech problem of defining how we co-exist with our new inventions is what I wanted to focus on for this article with one particular product in mind. The Oculus Rift, created by Palmer Luckey. In is set to re-definereality and technology as we now it.

      Oculus's foundation realies in the precipace that mass virtual reality is invetibale and having been bought up by Facebook for 2 billion dollers, is ready to transform our lives. Through my research I found that this technology exists in order to push boundaries and understand where we can go in our understanding of what's real and what's not. Oculus can described as the evolution of humanity. Oculus is vitrual reality, and has the possibility of pushing how we react socially.A computer generate world where you simulate moving, interating, and feeling. Oculus has created the most Advanced VR headset's this world has ever seen. For those tech obsessive consumers, they will soon be able to own this product. In a video with vice, Mr. Luckey says that, "We are headed to the maxtrix, where you will be able to swap in and out of real life and into not real life".
