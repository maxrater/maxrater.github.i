      For this exercise from the large list of values, I chose the following as reflecting values that come to mind when I think about times in my life where I've been the happiest, proudest, or the most satisfied: Accomplishment, Ambition, Confidence, coolness under fire, creativity, inspiration, Personal development, integrity, adventure, competence, congruance, justice, challenge, competition, control, courage, excellence, faith, music, persistance, will-power.

      In general I try to live up to these values (1-5):
      Accomplishment(5), Ambition(5), Confidence(5), Coolness Under Fire(5), Creativity(5), Inspiration(5), Personal Development(5), Integrity(5), Adventure(4), Competence(4), Congruance(5), Justice(5), Challenge(5), Competition(5), Control(3), Courage(4), Excellence(5), Faith(3), Music(5), Persistance(5), Will-Power(5). These are all values that I aspire to uphold, it's difficult but I always want to hold myself to the highest standards; I believe this is the best way to achieve your dreams.

      It wasn't originally on the list. I added congruance, because I believe it's important to truly represent yourself and be 100% a real person and in-line with everything that you speak about, and believe in. In order to achieve congruance with myself in programming, I need to continue working at a really high level because I want to be able to really know what I'm doing and know what I'm talking about. So when I say in the future I'm a software engineer or a program in Ruby or Javascript, I want to really understand programming like the back of my hand and not put on a front like I'm pretending to be something I'm not. This is really the most important to me because I think in society now we are all afraid of being relevant or becoming viral instead of working on something meaninful and putting in the time to really learn our field and become a master so that we can give back to society and teach each other important values.

      I asked two of my friends growing up for advice; my friends Will and Mathis. Will is a student at MIT and Mathis at BU, and value their opinions because they are both really intelligent and I've known them for years so I knew they would give me their true opinion on the matter. I asked them if they thought it would be better to move to New York City or San Francisco. I was trying to gauge which location for Dev Bootcamp would be right for me as this was a really big decision to make. When making this decision I had to reflect coolness under pressure, keep in mind my personal development, and ambition. This lead me to choose New York City as I had always wanted to live there before I go some place else!

      I believe knowing your true worth and value can help mitigate your stereotype threat. Society tries to put labels on you, and marginilize you, but even when in doubt you must strive to push boundaries and excell at your goals. I think understanding my values can really help put everything in focus because stereotype threat can be really harmful, and sometimes I feel like we are always surrounded by it. It's important to keep your values at the forefront and not letting anything stop you. This is what I do when I'm feeling down, just play this song:
