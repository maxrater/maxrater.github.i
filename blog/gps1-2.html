      <p>Peer programming is a a software development technique that allows two programmers to work as a pair on the same problem anywhere in the world. This is useful as the two programmers can bounce ideas off each other, and ideally arive to a solution more quickly than if they were doing the programming on their own. It's also useful in that it allows the programmers to divide up different roles and focus on differents tasks and aspects of the problem. In addition it's used as a learning process as programmers are able to learn from each other, whather that be in finding out methods that one programmer can teach to other, shortcut keys to get around the computer faster, or ways of doing things that other programmer hadn't even thought of.  </p>
      <!--What is pair programming?-->
      <p> Peer programming is the prefered method for Dev Bootcamp. It's how the programmers go through the rigouros 9-weeks of intensive learning. Dev Bootcamp holds it's own standard at looking at issues, and as I have been in the program since phase 0 it teaches you to change your thinking and focus your attention onto topics such as  having a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset, discovering your personal learning style, understanding the importance of emotional intellgience and it's competencies over your intelligence quotient. This all ties into peer programming as something that empowers you to become a better programmer. It forces you to get out of your comfort zone and engage with someone, and help each other learn. Since i've been peer programming in Dev Bootcamp, while I enjoy working on problems by myself, I have found that I can learn a lot from another programmer by the different ways they start a problem or arrive at a solution.

      <!--Why is pair programming important to DBC?-->
      <p>
      In peer programming roles are divided into Driver and Navigator parts. Like two actors on stage acting out a play, each has their role, or purpose, yet both have a common goal of wanting to do their best and solve the given problem. The Driver's role in the play is to write code, while the Navigator review seach line of code that is being typed. In peer programming it's also acceptable to switch roles actively. It's the Navigator's role to strategies, and the Driver's role to follow direction and communicate to the Navigator what they are writing and thinking about doing next. This allows the Driver to zoom in on the tactical portion of the programming and relying on the Navigator as a guide. The benefit is that while peer programmingmight take longer, it allows for there to be fewer bugs in your code. Economically this reduces expenses in fixing bad code. Peer programming also allows for a greater diversity of solutions, and thus both programmers benefit from their given roles.
