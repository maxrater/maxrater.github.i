In Ruby, Scope is defnied as the "reach" or "visibility" of identifiers, aka variables or constants. In Ruby's case, Ruby supports' 4 different variables. These variables are local variables, instance variables, class variables and global variables. These four variables (which I shall go into greater detail) enable the Ruby user to be in different "scope's" when using in their programs. Just as in American Sniper(starring Bradley Cooper) that is based on the real life events of Chris Kyle (nicknamed "Legend), Bradley Cooper is able to zoom in or out of a target, in Ruby we are able to zoom in or out of our method's based on the type of variable's we assign.
</p>
Local variables are written with lowercase letters or an underscore and are regimented with letters, underscores, and or digits.
    </p>
    <p>
Instance variables store information for individual objects that begin with an at-sign (@), and then follow the same format as local variable.
    </p>
<p>
Class variables store information in terms of classe's structurally, and segway into the same form as instance variables except that they are written  wtih two at-signs such as @@.
</p>
<p>
Global variables are written with a dollar sign in front (4). Everything after the dollar sign is the same as a local variable.
</p>
<p>
It's very important when dealing with the four different variables in Ruby, you must understand what scope you are in .As the laws of scope dictate the visibility of variables (and other elements like constants, but mostly variables),it's necessary to understand what scope you're in so that you can tell what the variables are refering to and if they can be accessed or not. In addition scope can change over the course of the program so that you must understand when and how these changes are occuring. We have four different variables in Ruby but there are two generalized different scopes. (There are other scopes that are in bweteen these scopes, such as instances of classes.)
</p>
<p>
  The global scope happens over the entirety of the program. As we mentiond previously global variables begin with a dollar sign ($) characteristic. They are able to be accessed everywhere in your program. For example in the marvel series X-Men, if Global variables had a power, they would be able to walk through walls. Basically, global variables are never out of scope.
</p>
<p>
  The local scope is going to the basics of Ruby functionality. During any moment of time your program is in a local scope. The local scope includes at the top level (outside of all definition blocks), every class or module definition, and every method definition. Ruby variable's that include a local scope include global variables.
