Stereotyping threat can be described as the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm thht stereotype. It's an explanation to frame the problems of underperforming. Initiated by Dr. Claud Steel who questioned why black students were underprforming their white counterparts without a socioeconomic disadvantage, Steroetyping threat describes a situation when a minority is underachieving. Mr. Steel's theory begins with  social identitiy, where he defines a group membership into categories of age, gender, religion and ethnicity. Mr. Steel explains that anxiety about being judged stereotypically as a woman, Black, or white male can be a very large hinderance to performance on important exams such as the SAT's.In order to express this in an alternate way, in different situations we can all be minorities, it doesn't have to all do with race. It could have to do with work structure, with a male driven work environment that makes it difficult for women to work in; in other wrods an atmosphere that is stressful and anxiety provoking that inhibits the success of the minority.

I felt this stereotyping threat when I was eighteen years old, I had just graduated from high school and took a year off (deferred from college) to pursue my passion in playing soccer at a high level. Growing up I always loved playing sports and I played everything: tennis, baseball, basketball, snowboarding. My best sport was soccer and so I did my research. I saw there was a program that brough american youth players, assimilating them into Madrid's youth system. At the time Spain (it was 2008, they would later go on to win the Euro's and the World Cup) Spain had one of the best national team's in the world when it came to soccer. I saw this as a chance to improve my skills and develop as a soccer player so that I could play at the collegiate level, as America's youth system (they have improved since) did not have the same level of instruction or competition as Spain. When I started playing against Spain's top youth talent I immedietley felt as If I had to prove myself, and just as The United States is well known for it's basketball players as being best in the world, it was the opposite for soccer. I was the minority, there was only a handful of American players on the team (Alcobenda's CF, plays in the 3rd Division in Spain), so it was difficult as I felt like if I did not perform I would be treated differently. Things started happening to me over that season after making the team. I felt like I was being treated differently. My coach told me that I needed to shave my head in order to start in my prefered position as striker, because that was the style the spaniard's were known for wearing (a type of haircut/mullet look) and I had grown my hair really long at the time. Yet there were other players on the team and he never asked this from any of them. I felt like I was being judged immediately when I was on the field as not having had the same caliber of training (which I didn't), yet I knew that I had the ability and a lot of times I felt I was not given the chance to prove myself. When I did play I was a substitue in the game. I would come on late and score or make an assist or do something really exciting to change the game, yet I continued as a substitue. It became apparent to me that this is how the season would go as I had just joined the team and the spanish players I was with had been playing together since the age of as young as 4 years old. Even if I deserved to play it took a lot to rotate me into the team as families had invested so much time in their son's and their son's in the team. This made me even more weary of messing up as I knew I was taking a roster spot that could have been used for another Spaniard and if I messed up in a game that would be it for me playing for several weeks. This is a problem that's faced still now as American's always have trouble playing abroad in the best leagues in the world, as team's make it difficult to entrust their nation's best team's to America's youth. In the end it was a really challenging time but I'm better for it and I learned a lot about culture differences and how to act when you are challenged in such a competative environment.
