Version Control, git and Github

11/23/14

This evening I'm going to be writing about Version Control, git and Github, which are all very important feature in programming. These are some really powerful tools that are instrumental in the functionality and ease from which you can use to program and write code.
Git creates a Version Control Management (VCS) workflow. This is a workflow system that allows developers to track and save changes, and makes sure there is one main file. It allows users to send data in real time. It allows you to be able to return to precise versions at a later date. This is really useful if you would like to go back and change something, if you do not like how you are progressing, or would like to switch to a previously saved point. Basically if user messes up, everything is fine; you simply can go back to an earlier version that you saved and proceed.
When using git there are three levels from which you need to know, in order to keep track of your changes: working, staged, and commit. The working stage of git is a previously saved commit (save point) where you can go and debug your code. Staged is when you mark a modified file in its present version to go into your next commit. Finally commit is when you safely store the data in your local database. Tracking and adding changes using git makes developer's lives easier because you are able to check the status of all the files in the local repository by typing in your terminal, “git status.” Whenever the state of a file is changed, it is tracked. This allows for the developer to better control their workflow, through this crafty way of better managing their files.
The purpose of using Github, which is a social coding website is to into all of this acting as the main base. It allows for developers to share their code and keep track of their changes using git. Github tells you information concerning changes that might have taken place-in Git, like who made the change, what the name of the change was, what was deleted or added, and what file was changed. While Git lives locally, on your computer, GitHub lives remotely, on the Internet. You can store and access your work online, on GitHub, but only if you are explicit and tell your computer to place it there; via a git push. What you are looking to finish locally on your computer will not just suddenly pop up remotely online. It's your position to produce the pathways and call the necessary commands. In conclusion Github is a host to your repository and allows for you to efficiently push and pull with whomever you are collaborating with.
