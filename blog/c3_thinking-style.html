While I was researching my learning style it was difficult because after I took Anthony Gregorc's exam I realized that I was almost tied evenly across the board with the four combinations of the strongest perceptual and ordering ability in each individual, except that I had scored one point higher in Concrete Random. Then I read through what Concrete Random and I realized that this made sense. This learner likes to experiment to find answers (Check). Take risks (Check). What's hard for them is Having no Options (Options are always better), and Restrictions and Limitations (Check). Of course when you get a Tarot card reading the mystic always seems to be able to say something generalized that you can identify with as being true or feels like it's true; yet this was written by an acclaimed researcher, lecturer, consultant, and author that has traveled the world and internationally recognized. So while I feel as though I am a little bit of all the styles, Concrete Random felt like it best embodied my learning stlye.

In order to help my team at DBC I think I have started on the right track by understanding my learning style and figuring out the best role I can play within our group framework. I can look at my strengths and weaknesses, see what my learning style says about my abilities to be a team player, and work with others in the most efficient of ways. I think my advantage will be that I am able to look outside myself and make a real judgment on a certain situation to see if I need to take more control or the person I am working with is doing well and I can sit back a little bit. I think this aspect is related to the driver and navigator roles in peer programming and my plan is to use my thinking style to constantly assess where I am in relation to my team, where I can improve through constructive criticism, and the direction I can best go in to help everyone around me get better.

Since beginning Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp I didn't necessarily know what to except. I understood I was going to be doing something that was going to be very difficult and challenge me, and that it wasn't going to be easy. I guess realistically I was expecting things to be more centered on Ruby and coding, and I didn't expect all of the mindfullness training, and other attributes that DevBootcamp highly regards, and tries to bring out in it students. After going through DevBootcamp's first three weeks I have learned way more than I thought was possible about a lot of aspects of programming that I didn't even know existed. This was really shocking to me and really cool at the same time. My biggest struggle can be pinpointed to three thing  s: the tail end of problems in the exercises in week-3 (17-20), when I was first learning navigating around git and github(push,pull,merge,fetch, and different git commands), and learning positioning in HTML/CSS(how to make everything look nice). This maybe could be related to my learning style. In concrete random it says that I like to solve problems independently, so maybe going forward I can ask for more help and get more involved in the community. At the same time we have just started and I have already learned so much so I don't know if I should be able to master all of these things already, but I guess I should be close; thinking about improving my learning style can never be bad.

When looking at a Fixed vs. Growth mindset I believe that this ties in perfectly to evertyhing that we are doing at Dev Bootcamp. If we have a fixed mindset we are limiting ourselves, stuck in a place where we want to achieve the same results, through the same practices, without taking any risks. A fixed mindset prohibits you from testing yourself and mitigates growth, as you try and maintain your sense of achievement. Dev Bootcamp calls for a Growth mindset where you are constantly seeking tests and pushing the envelope in order to propel yourself towards your goals and aspirations.You believe that intelligence and personality can be developed in order to become the person you want to be an accomplish those things you covet. I believe that in understanding the way my brain functions and holding these values true will help me be more successful and consequently shape my future.
