The internet is wire that is buried in the ground. It might be made of fiber optics, copper, or beamed to satellities or through cell phone networks. Two computer's connected directly to this wire can communicate. A server is a special computer that connected directly to the internet. Wepages are files on that server's hardrive. Every servier has a unique internet protocol adress or IP adress. Just like a postal adress, IP adresses help computers find each other. We also give our adresses names like facebook.com, google.com, twitter.com. You're computer at home is not a server because it is not connected directly to the internet. Our computers are called clients.They are connected indirectly to the internet through an internet service provider.

Whenever an email, picture, or webpage travel across the internet, computers break the information down into smaller pieces called packets. When information reaches it's destination,the packets are reassembled in their original order to make a picture, email, webpage, or tweet. An important piece in this tranporatation of information are routers, which help sort through everything. Each IP adress is directly addressable, so any router can direct your packet to any other part of the internet.
