      From its genesis Dev Bootcamp is upfront that it is an experiment, and that it’s model is ever changing, growing, and expanding. The awareness, that you can create so much value in such a short period of time through focus, hard work, and determination is Dev BootCamp’s appeal. It’s extremely inventive and challenging to teach programming like this, to have the ability to acquire a skill set that is so highly sought after, and from which you can envelop and immerse yourself into this new world of programming. Considering all things Dev BootCamp is an experiment but in the best way possible. It’s honest and upfront that it’s still a work in progress and it wants you to take advantage of everything that it has to offer. In order to understand Dev BootCamp you must look at its history.

       Dev Boot Camp was created as an experiment. The people who were part of the first cohort that was learning Ruby on Rails were all recruited based on the criteria or being humble, confident, passionate, hungry, and committed to learning. They were people you would want to hang out with for hours on end, everyday learning computer programming. From the beginning it was an experiment that was untested, and there were no assurances. Everyone apart of this group did something crazy, from dropping out of college to leaving their jobs. It was easy to question whether or not this was a scam. They all took a leap of faith.

      After a while things improved from the branding and image to hiring, networking, having speakers, mentors, challenges, and teachers infinitely enhancing the curriculum. So from the launch it’s teaching is that you must have the mindset that whatever happens is up to you, to take advantage, and commitment of the education process and something great will follow. What I have come to see is that code is not just thrown at you. It’s completely different than I thought it would be. Most of the battle is controlling your emotions, and reshaping your mindset and this enables you to do things that you wouldn’t have previously thought was possible. I’m really excited to engage with this culture of creativity, passion and possibly. What’s being begged of is a commitment to really go beyond limitations and see how we can blow each other’s minds.
