      Whenever you do not understand something or are seeking clarification it's important that you are able to convey where your confusion lies or the gaps of knowledge you are missing so that you can fill them in. This is especially true for coding, as memorizing code snippets does not lead to mastery. It's only through questioning the answer, and information that we can further our learning.

      In life there is always a better way in which we can do something. In sports you can always run faster, improve your technique, or increase your strength. In medicine you can always improve upon your findings and find new ways to heal. When you are asking a question, they way you ask it, the words you use, and the manner in which you ask it can always be improved in order to get a better answer.

      Another site that is very helpful in teaching you how to ask questions is: http://web.archive.org/web/20140703131211/http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html. In his blog how to ask questions the smart way,Eric Steven Raymond introduces the facts that in the world of the hacker, the kind of answers you get to your questions depends on the way you ask the question as well as the difficulty of developing your answer. It's important to understand that hackers have this re[utation for meeting simple questions with what appears to look like hostility or arrogance. Hackers are unapologeticallly hostile to people who are unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking a question. So before you ask your question you should try and go through the resources of unlocking the answer.
