I have always loved sports and since I was little I remember opening up the New York Times newspaper, tearing away to get to the busines section which I new within it's pages lay the sports fold. I would sit calmy taking in the new stories in baseball, read the league standings across the different leagues, and memorized statistics. As technology improved this crossed over to me curiously seeking out new blogs that would give me new insight's into whatever I was into next from Olympic snowboarding, tennis, the world cup and boxing. While I would always felt satisfied taking in quick bites of easy digestable information something was a miss. I needed something that I could really sink my teeth into, something that would really generate a new kind of stimulation.

Whenever It came to reading, there was always a love hate relationship. My father taught me how to read at a young age. My sister had systematically taught herself at an age younger than when it was deamed necessary I start, so it was extremely pertinent that I catch up. My first book was Treasure Island, and afterwords my mother would take as to the library sometimes all day where we would collect stickers for every book we read. But as the years went by and I found myself starting at App's on my new Iphone, feeding my ADD by surfing the internet for endless depthless articless, and not challenging myself, it was decided. I would read classic.

I chose Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens; because of how grandiose it sounded. I had heard that Dickens was an incredible writer, and I decided to delete my facebook, and turn my attention to a literary masterpiece. I so glad to do so as it's the best book I've ever read. Reading is something that's different than watching a movie. It takes a while to get into, as we've trained our brains to want fast information snippets. We watch our favorite show on netflix, or on demand, and it's difficult to get ourselves to relax and re-focus our minds. Reading someone's work who was a master at what he does is something I will always enjoy. Even though I missed the sports articles, going on SnapChat, etc... nothing could beat a really good book as it inspired and changes your perception of reality.
