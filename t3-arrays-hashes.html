    Arrays
    <p>
Arrays and Hashes are used in order to store information, and they each have their own way of doing it. Array's can be used to store a list of values in a single variable. When creating your array, keep in mind that you can code in any variant of numbers, you can repeat numbers, and nothing has to be in any numeric mandate. In order to understand what an array is, you must know that each element in an array has an index. Its index is counted beginning at 0, and going up from there; with the next index counted as 1, and continuing forward. This is displayed in the example below from codeacademy:

<p>
This gives us the ability to access elements of the array directly through these numbers. Arrays are useful if we want to make index are list. Here are examples of Arrays.

<p>
This is an example of a multi-dimensional array, or an array within an array aka inception...

    <p>
If we don’t want to use numbers or indices, we can use a new array structure called a hash!

</p>

<p>
A hash is a collection of data where each element of data is addressed by a name. Hashes are used when we don’t really care what order they are in. Hashes can be compared to JavaScript objects or Python dictionaries. A hash is an assembly of key-value pairs. A Hash syntax looks like this: *picture. Keys are on the left side and contain an arrow (=>), which is used to assign its value on the right side. This => is called a rocket.

<p> In this example I created a hash filled with music artists and one of their famous songs... </p>

<p>
A Hash can also be created by writting Hash.New and using bracket notation to list the keys and it's values.  This creates a new empty hash and is equivalent to setting a variable equal to empty curly braces.  A Hash.new uses bracket notation. We can access values in a hash just like an array.
