There are three CSS Positioning Types: Absolute, Relative and Fixed. Although when you are positioning using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) the default position type is Static, which basically means, "this is where the elements go ordinarily." All of these positionings are very different as well as useful depending on the result you are looking for. In order to help you understand positining it's good to remember that every element on a web page is a block, an assortment of pixels and has it's own width and height to stretch or shrink it's form.

Absolute positioning means an element is positioned in relation to it's first parent element, that doesn't have a static position. If there isn't any element with a static position, absolute becomes positioned in relation to <html>. This lets you place any page element perfectly whever you might want it. You use the settings of top, bottom, left and right to create the positioning.
    </p>
    <p>
Relative positioning means it is positioned relative to itself. This means an element is moved relative to where it would have been if it was labeled with the static positioning. If you set an element with relative positioning and no attributes than there will be no effect in it's positioning. But if you give it a positioning of15px(pixels), than it will shift 15 px to the right.
    </p>
Fixed positioning means an element is anchored to the browser window. It is metaphorically glued to the screen. When you scroll the page it will stay right where it is.
