# Week 6: Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

<!-- Please do not start on week 6 yet, we will be reviewing the challenges and making changes. It will be published at least by the Sunday before week 6 starts. -->

Last week you started creating your own objects in Ruby. This week you will be working with something called Object-Oriented Design. We are asking students to purchase [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/) (affectionately pronounced "Poo-Dur") to help them with these ideas.

You'll also want to look through any chapters you haven't read yet, re-read material you found confusing, and practice some of the things you're seeing in the *Well-Grounded Rubyist*.

## Challenges
Before you start the challenges this week, we recommend you read chapters 1 and 2 in POODR. If you can, you should try to read the remainder of the chapters as you work through the challenges.

1. [Drawer Debugger](1-drawer-debugger)
2. [Variable Scope](2-variable-scope)
3. [PezDispenser](3-PezDispenser) **or** [Playlist](3-playlist)
4. [BINGO 2- SOLO CHALLENGE](4-bingo-2-solo-challenge)
5. [Introduction to Inheritance](5-inheritance)
6. [Refactoring for Code Readability](6-refactoring)
7. [Technical Blog](7-technical-blog.md)
8. [Cultural Blog](8-cultural-blog.md)
9. [GPS 2.2](9-gps2-2)<br>
10. [BONUS Challenges](10-BONUS-challenges)

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU2W6.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday at 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 2 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 2)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

## Fetch the curriculum changes!

It's time to fetch the new curriculum from Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-2. Make sure to check your directory before fetching changes! Use [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md). Change all instances of phase-0-unit-1 to phase-0-unit-2.

## Completing the challenges

Open your local version of the directory in Sublime. Make your changes, commit, and push as you complete challenges. Try using the command line as much as possible to navigate between directories and run files.

Make sure to include specific commit messages and push your changes each time you complete a challenge.
