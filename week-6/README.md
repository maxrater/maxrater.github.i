# Week 6: Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

Please do not start on week 6 yet, we will be reviewing the challenges and making changes. It will be published at least by the Sunday before week 6 starts.

<!-- Last week you started creating your own objects in Ruby. This week you will be working with something called Object-Oriented Design. We recommend [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/) (affectionately pronounced "Poo-Dur"). There aren't legally free copies online, so if you don't want to shell out the bucks to buy it (although we highly recommend it) use the mighty power of Google to introduce yourself to the fundamentals of object-oriented design. (But we promise, the book is well worth the money!)

If you're using the *Well-Grounded Rubyist*, you'll want to look through any chapters you haven't read yet, re-read material you found confusing, and practice some of the things you're seeing.

## Challenges
Before you start the challenges this week, we recommend you read chapters 1 and 2 in POODR. If you can, you should try to read the remainder of the chapters as you work through the challenges.

1. [Drawer Debugger](1-drawer-debugger)
2. [Variable Scope](2-variable-scope)
3. [PezDispenser](3-PezDispenser) **or** [Playlist](3-playlist)
4. [BINGO 2- SOLO CHALLENGE](4-bingo-2-solo-challenge)
5. [Introduction to Inheritance](5-inheritance)
6. [Refactoring for Code Readability](6-refactoring)
7. [Technical Blog](7-technical-blog.md)
8. [Cultural Blog](8-cultural-blog.md)
9. [GPS 2.2](9-gps2-2)<br>
10. [BONUS Challenges](10-BONUS-challenges)

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU2W6.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to "turn in" your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday at 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 2 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 2)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

## Remember your Expectations for the Unit!
- Pair at least twice this week.  *You need to pair* ***6*** *times this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 8 pieces of feedback in this unit* (6 for peer-pairing, and 2 GPS)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit. Don't forget or you won't get your feedback!*

## Fetch the curriculum changes!

It's time to fetch the new curriculum from Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-2. **Make sure to check your directory before fetching changes!** Use [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md). **Change all instances of phase-0-unit-1 to phase-0-unit-2.**

## Completing the challenges

Open your local version of the directory in Sublime. Make your changes, commit, and push as you complete challenges. Try using the command line as much as possible to navigate between directories and run files.

Make sure to include specific commit messages and push your changes each time you complete a challenge.


## Submitting your work

You need to submit your work on the Unit 2, Week 6 submission form on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. Expect to submit the links from your repo for each challenge above.


## Broken links in the repository
As you might imagine, links change all the time. We don't always know what's changed. We should be responsible for broken internal links, but external links are much more difficult to keep track of.

We'd like to ask you a favor. If you run into a 404 error navigating through the directory online, please go to the file where the error is and view the link. Is it to an internal or external file? If it's an internal file, you should see something with a similar name in the week repository and can click on that. If it's external, please search for it on Google. Either way, please let us know the link is broken. We will fix it immediately!

It would also be a great time for you to fix the repos on your own and make a pull request to the Devbootcamp master repository. Do some research on how to do that if you'd like to contribute.
