# U2.W4: Connect with Your Accountability Group

## Learning Competencies
- Identify the concepts you struggled with
- Explain your confusion to your accountability group

## Summary
Accountability groups are designed to give you a core group of people in your cohort to lean on and learn from. From now on you will have a challenge to connect/meet with them each week. As a group you can decide to connect weekly via hangouts, in person, or email. You may want to initiate a code review process within your accountability group as well.

Double-check your groups as they may have changed.

## Releases:
## Release 0: Identify Concepts
Identify one or two of the concepts/challenges you struggled with this week.

## Release 1: Discuss
Using the means your group decided to use for communication, explain the concepts that confused you and ask your accountability group members for help.

The other members of your group will have similar questions or can explain the parts that were confusing. Interact with one another and try to help each other out as much as possible.

## Release 2: Lack of Engagement
If there is a member of your group who does not engage, please email <phase0@devbootcamp.com> to let us know. We will follow up with the person or provide you with aditional information.
